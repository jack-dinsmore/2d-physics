# The Physics of Flatland

An astronaut looking down at us from a space station might say you and I are fixed to a surface. From their great height, the tallest skyscrapers are invisible, and even Mount Everest looks like only a gentle mound on the vast stretch of two-dimensional land. But we who live on the surface know that we are not stuck to the face of the Earth; we can jump in the air, we can move up and down buildings, and we can fly above the clouds in airplanes.

A biologist in one such building might look at some microbes in a slide. Like the astronaut, to them the microbes are constrained by the slide and the slide cover to move on a two-dimensional surface. But the organelles within the microbe are still able to move in the third dimension, passing over each other to transport the energy and resources necessary to maintain life.

A physicist might study the properties of electrons in graphene, which is famous for being exactly one carbon atom thick. (Graphite, or pencil lead, is made of many layers of graphene.) The free electrons have fascinating properties caused by the two-dimensional structure of atoms, but within each atom, the bound electrons still orbit in the familiar three-dimensional orbitals you might have seen in chemistry class.

The question I seek to answer in this blog is "What would a _truly_ two-dimensional world look like?" One in which even the electron orbitals were squished flat, microbes truly do exist on a plane, and planets (if they still exist) are disks. The consequences of this flattening is not as simple as merely taking a cross-section of our universe. Instead, new properties of matter and new behavior will be introduced which lead to an entirely foreign universe.

I view this question as fascinating not only because of the intricacies that arise (as you will see) but because by discovering about how a universe unlike our own would operate, we learn more about this one. We learn which physical principles lead to which behaviors in our universe, revealing the inner mathematical structure of physics. We might even be able to guess _why_ our universe is three-dimensional: if a two-dimensional universe cannot support life, perhaps the reason our universe is three-dimensional is because it is the simplest (meaning lowest-dimensional) universe that can.

## Target audience

The math and physics in this blog can get pretty advanced, but I've tried to write it so that if you get bored or confused, you can skip to the conclusions. I've also tried to provide references if you want to learn more. For important topics like linear algebra and calculus, I wrote some posts explaining the basics of the math.

I'm in the somewhat unique position that what I write here doesn't have to teach you how to do problems, which is the purpose of many other educational resources, both online and in print. That means I'll sometimes try to give intuitive descriptions of phenomena when possible, avoiding equations unless I intend to use them. In case what I'm doing is too abstract, I will also provide external links to resources that present material in more traditional formats.

Overall, I hope someone who took one or two physics classes at a college would be able to understand the conclusions of each post, and a physics major would be able to understand most of the reasoning. If I haven't achieved this goal, I'd love some feedback!

## Table of Contents

We'll start with an introduction to the project, going over the basic assumptions and methods. Then we'll discuss how classical mechanics and Newton's laws change when going from 2D to 3D (they don't). What does change are quantum mechanics and gravity, so I explore those topics next in order from the smallest building blocks of the universe (particles) to the largest structures (galaxies). Finally, we discuss biology, which pulls from every branch of physics.
